# Business Problem
Recently, Facebook introduced a new bidding type called "average bidding" as an alternative to the current "maximum bidding" type.
One of our clients, xxx.com, decided to test this new feature and wants to determine if average bidding brings more conversions than maximum 
bidding through an A/B test. The A/B test has been ongoing for 1 month and xxx.com is now expecting you to analyze the results of this
A/B test. The ultimate success metric for xxx.com is Purchase, so statistical tests should focus on the Purchase metric.

# Dataset Story
There are two separate data sets in this data set containing information about a company's website, including the number of advertisements seen
and clicked by users, as well as revenue information from here. These data sets are in separate sheets in the ab_testing.xlsx excel, and are 
divided into Control and Test groups. Maximum Bidding was applied to the Control group, and Average Bidding was applied to the Test group.

# Features
- Impression: Number of advertisements displayed
- Click: number of clicks on displayed advertisements
- Purchase: number of products purchased after clicking on ads
- Earning: revenue obtained after purchasing products
